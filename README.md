Materials of video PE #64: Closed-Loop Compensators: PI versus PID

Available at: https://youtu.be/CnjmIiKvQik

This video shows a comparison of PI versus PID compensators for closed-loop operation of a buck dc-dc converter. The design of both compensators is explained in detail. Qspice simulations are shown to illustrate the behavior of both compensators.
